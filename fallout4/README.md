# ðŸŒµ Fallout 4: Mojave inspired modlist
This modlist is not very lore friendly, and aims at transforming the Commonwealth of Fallout 4 to resemble the Mojave desert found in Fallout: New Vegas. 
The mods have been picked as to keep it as immersive as possible, with some handmade weapon mods added since the vanilla games suck.

Some prerequisits: 
- Fallout 4 Script Extender is **required**, install it as per instructions on the [silevrlock webpage](https://f4se.silverlock.org/). <br>(Drag and drop the contents into the Fallout4 steam folder...)
- Fallout 4 ENB is **required** to get the same look as me in the screenshots. <br>Again, please see the [ENB webpage](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_fallout4.htm) for more details. As of writing this modlist, it is ENB version 0.468.

<br>*Patroling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter...*<br>

## Frameworks
General mods that are **required** by a lot of other mods to work. These are always needed.

## User interface
These mods greatly alter the UX and uses the FallUI pre-defined layouts to get a Fallout: New Vegas interface. You can chose layout based on your own preference. 
Furthermore, some mods removes the annoying player voice lines and makes the dialogue camera subjective. These are also optional and can be removed if you for some reason actually enjoy listening to horrendous voice acting and writing...

## Visuals, graphics, weather etc.
The core of the modlist. BADLANDS 2, Desperados, and NAC X are **required** to get the wanted Mojave like overhaul to the otherwise boring Commonwealth. Mods like True Storms are somewhat optional, but together with Desperados can add some really cool and immersive desert sandstorms to spice up the gameplay. Less is more!

## Weapons and armour
Either retextures or handmade new weapons and armour mods. Majority of these are immersive and lore-friendly, but I am still looking for more armour mods that would fit with the Mojave / Fallout: New Vegas aesthetic. As always, subject to change whenever I find mods that are suitable.

## Gameplay
General gameplay changes, not a lot right now but is subject to change. Some aiming for immersion, like movemnt speed changes, but the Idiot Savant mod is the definition of not lore-friendly nor immerisve. But it offers some well needed changes to the perk so I like it.
