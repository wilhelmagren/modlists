# :palm_tree::cowboy_hat_face: Fallout 4: Mojave inspired modlist

*<center><blockquote><br>Patrolling the Mojave almost makes you wish for a nuclear winter.<br><br></blockquote></center>*


<br>This is a modlist aimed at transforming the dull, boring, and lackluster Commonwealth into a luscious, bright, and jawdropping desert resembling the Mojave desert found in Fallout: New Vegas. Majority of the mods in this modlist either overhaul the landscape or modify the user interface. Some gameplay changes and new weapons and armours are included in this modlist, but they should be regarded as optional. The general goal is to offer the player a unique playthrough of Fallout 4, as if Boston was located in the Mojave desert...

<br>

# Prerequisites
I recommend using [Mod Organizer 2](https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/6194) for managing the mods. Some might find this tedious as you have to deal with .ini files through the mod managers, but generally it offers more fine-tuning capabilities and control than other mod managers. 

If you are not going to use Mod Organizer 2, [The Load Order Optimisation Tool](https://loot.github.io/) is a necessity to correctly sort the .esp plugins of the mods. However, some manual tweaking has to be performed to manage custom LODs for the overhaul mods.

[Fallout 4 Script Extender](https://f4se.silverlock.org/) is **required** for basically all modding in Fallout 4. It is such a great resource and vastly improves and expands on the scripting capabilities of the game. Follow the installation instructions on the provided webpage.

If you want to get the same ingame look and aesthetics as me, then you are going to need an [ENB](http://enbdev.com/download_mod_fallout4.htm). It is a 3D graphics modification program that modifies the rendering function calls and applies additional effects, based on chosen ENB preset. As of writing this modlist, the latest ENB version is 0.468.

# Mods
Below I will list all of the mods and their respective nexus link, categorized based on what the mod provides to the modlist. If you notice some dead links or mods that have been hidden, please open an issue referring to the specific mod and this modlist!


## Frameworks
General mods that are **required** by a lot of other mods to work. These are almost always needed. Download all to be on the safe side. However, CBBE and Armorsmith might not be needed if you are not going to install the Weapons and Armour mods later.

## User Interface
These mods greatly alter the UX and uses the FallUI pre-defined layouts to get a Fallout: New Vegas styled interface. You can chose layout based on your own preference. 
Furthermore, some mods removes the annoying player voice lines and makes the dialogue camera subjective. These are also optional and can be removed if you for some reason actually enjoy listening to horrendous voice acting and writing in the vanilla game...

## Visuals and Weather Overhauls
The core of the modlist. BADLANDS 2, Desperados, and NAC X are **required** to get the wanted Mojave like overhaul to the otherwise boring Commonwealth. Mods like True Storms are somewhat optional, but together with Desperados can add some really cool and immersive desert sandstorms to spice up the gameplay. I decided to use the DECENT ENB which offers some stunning visuals whilst also keeping the gameplay feeling normal and intact.

## Gameplay
General gameplay and quality of life changes. Some with the aim for more immersion, like movemnt speed changes, but the Idiot Savant mod is the definition of not lore-friendly nor immersive. I like it though, since it offers some well needed changes to the perk. Again, please add any mods here that you seem fit in Mojave styled fallout game.
